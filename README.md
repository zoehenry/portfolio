### Crossy Elm
This is the final project I made for my first programming course.  The game is inspired by Crossy Road, but takes place at Yale.  I worked on this project in a 3 person group, and most of my work was focused in designed the background, movement of the cars, and detection of when the car and the person had the same coordinates.

### ENAS 118 Videos
These videos are part of the final project I did for an overarching engineering course.  This project was to create a product that would make it easier for the Peabody Museum to explain the formation of crystals to elementary school students.  My group created a 4 sided prism that when placed on top of a tv screen reflected an image on each side.  These reflected images make it appear as though a 3D image is hovering above the screen.  My main focus on this project was to create the video for the formation of Quartz and to be the liason between the Peabody Museum and my team.  Here are the 4 videos I made to create each view of the crystal forming.  I taught myself how to use Blender, and made the videos using this 3D modeling software.  The other four members on my group created videos for two other crystals and built the apparatus used to display these videos.  The video of the apparatus is a video that one of teammates made.
