You got to your class 30 minutes late. Thankfully, the red bull you drank earlier gave you super powers. You made that exam your subordinate. Good job!
Nothing but a car would stop you from getting to class. It was canceled. You only found out after checking emails in Yale Health. 
You got there 15 minutes late.  You got a 0 on your assessment and now you have a D.
The car ran you over. Now you won't be able to take your exam. You lost your health and the grade.
