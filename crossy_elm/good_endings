You made it with just a few moments to spare. You didn't have socks on. You didn't brush your teeth. And, after finding a pencil on the floor. YOU KILLED IT!
Phew!. Good thing you've been running lately. You made it to class on time. But your professor was 15 minutes late
You got there right before attendance. And TFs were giving out donuts!
You were the first person to class. because it was canceled. Better safe than sorry!
